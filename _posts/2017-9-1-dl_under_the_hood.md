title: Deep Learning - Under the Hood!
---

In this post I will walk the reader through the stack of a Deep Learning Application (Object Detection in this case). We will see what happens when a camera installed in an autonomous vehicle takes a photograph, until a Neural Network model identifies all the objects in the image - and everything in between. Object Detection has made rapid strides in the Deep Learning era. For the sake of this article we will look into Faster R-CNN, one of the state of the art model architectures used by many Self Driving Cars.
